## Dataset- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sgpjesus/bank-account-fraud-dataset-neurips-2022
###  It's designed to be a comprehensive, realistic test bed with over 32 attributes. My goal was to leverage this data to visualize trends and develop a machine learning model to predict bank fraud transactions.
